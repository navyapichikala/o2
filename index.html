    When she was two, the family moved to Madhavnagar, Sangli in Maharashtra, where she completed her schooling. 
    Both her father and brother, Shravan, played cricket at the district-level, for Sangli. She was inspired to 
    take up cricket after watching her brother play at the Maharashtra state Under-16s tournaments. At the age of 
    nine, she was selected in the Maharashtra's Under-15 team. At eleven, she was picked for the Maharashtra 
    Under-19s team.

    distributor, takes care of her cricket programme, her mother Smita is in charge of her diet, clothing and 
    other organisational aspects, and her brother Shravan still bowls to her in the nets.
